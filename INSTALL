WARNING:

Since arp-sk-0.13, the default install path is set to /usr/local/sbin,
rather than /usr/local/bin. So, if you installed a previous version,
be sure to remove the former binary from /usr/local/bin.




--[  1. Get libnet-1.1  ]--

arp-sk rests on libnet-1.1.

http://www.packetfactory.net/projects/libnet/

See Libnet files to install it.


--[  2. Configure  ]--

Note that this is my very first configure script, so be cool ;) For
instance, I intend to add a test to check your libnet version, but it
fails under BSD.

Available arguments are:

  --with-libnet=DIR
    use if you need to specify is the location of libnet-1.1

  --with-sigsend (default is yes)
    by default, the timing and sending mechanisms rests upon the
    alarm(2) function, i.e. it sends SIGALARM and a special callback
    function performs the sending and re-initializes the timer.
    With this option, you can disable this by simply running: 
        ./configure --without-sigsend

  --with-arpcache=FILE  [default: /proc/net/arp]
    Set the file that is going to be used as ARP cache for some
    addresses lookup. 

    If your system has a /proc/net/arp file, there is no need to set
    this option. On most Linux distributions, this file exists so you
    won't have to change anything. 

    On BSD system, I handle arp cache directly through sysctl(), so
    this option should be useless.

    With other systems, this flag may be a way to feed arp-sk with the
    expected values for IP/MAC addresses. If you use this flag, it
    will overwrite the default behavior of your system. For instance,
    on BSD, you won't use sysctl() anymore.


    The provided MUST have the following structure:

    IP address      HW type  Flags   HW address          Mask  Device
    192.168.24.61   0x1      0x6     08:00:2B:87:24:0A   *     eth0
    192.168.1.100   0x1      0x6     00:10:FF:6E:38:A0   *     eth0
    192.168.1.23    0x1      0x6     08:00:20:C1:12:A4   *     eth0
    192.168.18.7    0x1      0x2     08:00:69:12:48:05   *     eth0
    192.168.24.103  0x1      0x2     00:D0:B7:C9:74:13   *     eth0

    HW type : 0x1 is Ethernet
    Flags : must be any "valid" value, ie such that (<val> & 0x02) != 0
    (See net/if_arp.h)


--[  3. Compile  ]--

Run 'make' (or gmake) and it should be fine. 

The binary arp-sk is in the directory src/.

If there are errors or warnings, please drop me a mail.

Note:
You may see this warning (and similar ones):
strcasecmp.c:3: warning: ISO C forbids an empty source file

If you know howto avoid it, let me know.
