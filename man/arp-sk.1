.TH ARP-SK 1 "24 August 2002" "Cédric Blancher" "arp-sk \- A swiss knife tool for ARP"
.SH NAME
arp-sk \- A swiss knife tool for ARP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arp-sk
.BR MODE
.BR OPTIONS
.TP
where \fBMODE\fP is either one among BASIC or ADVANCED and \
\fBOPTIONS\fP lets you control each address of the ARP message (at \
link \fBand\fP logical layers - i.e. Ethernet and IP addresses), and \
lots of other sending parameters (interface, frequency, amount, and so on).
.PP
.SH DESCIRPTION
.B arp-sk
is an ARP packet generator aimed to illustrate ARP protocol fails. It allows
custom packets to be generated from link layer to ARP layer.
.TP
It supports currently only Ethernet and IP protocols but is designed \
to also work with other addresses (in a far away future ;-) 
.SH BASIC MODES
.TP
.B -w, --who-has
Send an ARP Who-has.
.TP
.B -r, --reply
Send a ARP Reply.
.SH ADVANCED MODES
.TP
None are yet implemented but they should appear very soon. They should \
be considered as combinations and shortcuts of what you can do by \
sending several basic packets.
.TP
.B -o, --spoof
For those used to Dug Song's arpspoof in dsniff (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
.TP
.B -p, --arping
(bad) RARP emulation. (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
.TP
.B -m, --arpmim
Man in the Middle. (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
.SH LINK LAYER OPTIONS
.TP
These parameters let you control what will appear in the packet at \
link layer (Ethernet addresses of the ARP message). These addresses \
don't need to be the same as those specified in the ARP message \
itself. The RFC 826 (ARP's one) does not specify that there \
must be some consistency between ARP and Ethernet layer. That means \
you can provide uncorrelated addresses between these 2 layers.
.TP
This is very useful if \
you want reach all hosts on the network (use broadcast address as \
destination) or a particular host (the gateway for instance), or you \
can hide the source of the ARP message by providing a fake source \
address.
.TP
Here, you can provide either a hostname, an IP address or a \
MAC address. If you use a hostname or an IP address and that Ethernet \
address is not present in your ARP cache, a malformed DNS packet \
is sent to the target. But since the cache does not contain the \
Ethernet address, an ARP query is firstly sent on the network. The \
target answers with an ARP and you got the Ethernet address.
.TP
.B -d, --dst HOST
Set link layer destination.
.BR HOST
can be a hostname, an IP address or a
MAC address.
.TP
.B -s, --src HOST
Set link layer source.
.BR HOST
can be a hostname, an IP address or a MAC
address.
.TP
.B --rand-hwa
Set random addresses in link header
.TP
.B --rand-hwa-dst
Set random destination in link header.
.TP
.B --rand-hwa-src
Set random source in link header.
.SH LOGICAL LAYER OPTIONS
.TP
These parameters let you control what will appear in the ARP message \
itself, that is mainly the pairs <IP:MAC> for both source and \
destination hosts.
.TP
You can specify either both IP and MAC (1.1.1.1:11:11:11:11:11:11), \
only IP (1.1.1.1, information provided is the link layer will be used \
to complete the ARP message), or only MAC (:11:11:11:11:11:11, then IP \
is set to broadcast).
.TP
.B -D, --arp-dst HOST[:MAC]
Set logical layer destination.
.BR HOST
can be a hostname or an IP address. A MAC address can be specified with
.BR MAC.
If not,
.BR HOST
will be resolved.
.TP
.B -S, --arp-src HOST[:MAC]
Set logical layer source.
.BR HOST
can be a hostname or an IP address. A MAC address can be specified with
.BR MAC.
If not,
.BR HOST
will be resolved.
.TP
.B --rand-arp
Set random addresses in ARP message.
.TP
.B --rand-arp-dst
Set random destination adsresses in ARP message.
.TP
.B --rand-arp-src
Set random source addresses in ARP message.
.TP
.B --rand-arp-hwa-dst
Set random destination MAC address in ARP message.
.TP
.B --rand-arp-log-dst
set random dst IP address in ARP message.
.TP
.B --rand-arp-hwa-src
Set random source MAC address in ARP message.
.TP
.B --rand-arp-log-src
Set random source IP address in ARP message.
.SH MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
.TP
.B -i, --interface IFACE
Use
.BR IFACE
as output interface (default: eth0).
.TP
.B -c, --count NUM
Send
.BR NUM
packets
.TP
.B -T, --time NUM
Wait the
.BR NUM
seconds between sending each packet (
.BR NUM
can be prefixed with u for microseconds)
.TP
.B --rand-time NUM
Randomize the sending period of the packets by adding a random salt choosen
between
.BR -NUM
and
.BR NUM.
.TP
.B --beep
Beep for each packet sent.
.TP
.B --use-ts
Send an icmp-timestamp to resolve MAC to IP.
.TP
.B -n, --network ADDRESS
Use
.BR ADDRESS
as broadcast address for sending icmp-timestamp.
.TP
.B -N, --call-dns
Force address name resolution. This should never be used since it
sends DNS messages on the LAN and slows down performances of arp-sl.
.TP
.B -V, --version
Print version and exit.
.TP
.B -h, --help
